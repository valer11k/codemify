// Challenge 8: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
// instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples
// of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
// No need for permutations as there are no arguments to this function. Check the printed output.
